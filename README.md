## Currently in the process of clean-up and restart for new game implementation.

### To compile (currently Linux only)
  1. Clone into the repository
  2. In root, <code>mkdir build</code>
  3. <code>cd build</code>
  4. <code>cmake ../</code>
  5. <code>make occ-accessibility-tour</code>
  6. <code>./occ-accessibility-tour</code>

### Things to do:
  - Cross-compatibility
  - Menu voice operations
  - Continuous speech transmission & translation
