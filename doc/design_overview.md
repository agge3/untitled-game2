Premise:
    2D dungeon crawler (NES Zelda clone)
        3 attack styles:
            melee - q
            ranged/archery - w
            mage/fireballs - e
            ultimate ability - r
    Basic enemies
    Items to collect (upgrades?)
    Different 2D dungeons to traverse

    Melee:
        fists -> first!
        1st -> club: slow, high-ish dmg, beginning item
        2nd -> sword: fast, med dmg, mid game
        3rd -> katana: super fast, high dmg (slightly less than club), end game
    Range:
        rocks -> first!
        1st -> bow
        2nd -> crossbow
        3rd -> colt revolver: literally one-shots (why? because funny/cool)
    Mage:
        none -> mage is powerful
        staff 1: fire, dots
        staff 2: ice, slow
        staff 3: lighting, is just cool
        staff 4: elemental, combines all elements
    Ultimate (can choose 1 option / equip slot):
        1 -> slow down time
        2 -> nuke everything on screen
        3 -> slow down time, move full speed, one shot everything

Scope of maps:
    5 stages, each biome/texture
    forest -> snow -> rainforest -> desert -> death/final stage (escape from)
        a few different screens on map, probably starting at 1, going up from there (prolly 5)

Enemy types
    forest -> bunnies, deer, bear
    snow -> polar bear, sabertoothe, ice trolls
    rainforest -> poison snakes, tribesman, ancient tiki gods
    desert -> giant poison spiders, sphinx, dead egyptian mummies
        possible transion to death, raid tomb ->
    death -> scarier egyptian mummies, lost souls/Charon's lost souls, copies of player/anti-player/fractures of evil spirit consciousness, final -> Hades

* Probably going to keep it very simple, 5 biomes, 1 room for each enemy type, empty rooms (no collision)
    fight each enemy once, in boss form, then pickup weapon upgrade at end of biome

* Make working game mechanics without textures, leave blank sprites. Update sprites and textures after

IDEA: bunny attack...
    each level double the bunnys spawn ->
    keeps track of score ->
    until you die
