# TODO
* Doxygen tag every file and create INCLUDE_GRAPH<br>
* Change engine to operate on scene-to-scene, each scene deletes old scene and
creates object for new scene<br>

# Speech-to-Text
* add hidden easter eggs:
    * "hey siri", "hey alexa", "ok google", "hey occ"

* different languages with different models??

* Lower beam size will speed up decoding (how many sentence structures to look
  at).
